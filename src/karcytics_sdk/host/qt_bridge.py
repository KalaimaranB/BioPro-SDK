"""Cross-thread bridge for calling into Qt-owned state from a background thread.

`CoreServicesServer` dispatches each RPC on one of `ThreadingHTTPServer`'s
worker threads, never the Qt GUI thread. A handler that only emits a Qt
signal is already safe as written — Qt auto-queues cross-thread
signal->slot delivery onto the receiver's own thread — but a handler that
directly touches widgets (`setStyleSheet`, opening a dialog, anything that
isn't "emit and return") is not: Qt requires those calls happen on the
thread that owns the `QApplication`. `QtThreadBridge` is the one place that
marshals such a call onto that thread and blocks the caller for its result.
