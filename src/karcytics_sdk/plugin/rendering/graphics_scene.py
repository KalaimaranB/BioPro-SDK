"""Dirty-region-aware `QGraphicsScene`/`QGraphicsView` base classes.

Qt's own dirty-rect tracking already turns a `QGraphicsItem.update()` call
into a minimal invalidated-region repaint, as long as the view's
`ViewportUpdateMode` isn't `FullViewportUpdate`. Several plugin canvases
built before this module existed set `FullViewportUpdate` explicitly (often
to paper over a missing `prepareGeometryChange()` call somewhere), forcing a
full-viewport repaint on every single item change. `DirtyTrackingGraphicsView`
defaults to `MinimalViewportUpdate` instead, and `DirtyTrackingGraphicsScene`
adds an opt-in debug check to help catch the missing-`prepareGeometryChange()`
bug class that mode change can expose.

    `mark_dirty()` is a drop-in replacement for a bare `item.update()` call.
    When the `KARCYTICS_STRICT_DIRTY_TRACKING` environment variable is set,
    it additionally remembers each item's last-seen `boundingRect()` and
    warns when it differs from what was recorded the previous time
    `mark_dirty()` was called for that item. This is an imperfect signal —
    it cannot see whether `prepareGeometryChange()` was actually called in
    between — but a bounding-rect change it catches is a real prompt to
    check: under `MinimalViewportUpdate`, a geometry change that skipped
    `prepareGeometryChange()` can leave stale or clipped pixels on screen,
    a bug that Qt's default `FullViewportUpdate` mode silently masks.
