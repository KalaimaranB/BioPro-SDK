"""Real, permanent-home services for a plugin process pinned to
`process_model = "isolated"`.

An isolated plugin's own standalone `.venv` never depends on the Hub's own
`karcytics` package — it isn't importable there at all, in any mode — so a
call site written as `from karcytics.core.task_scheduler import
task_scheduler` (or `event_bus`, `diagnostics`, `tutorial_manager`) was
always going to be wrong once that plugin runs isolated, not just
"incompatible until shimmed". This module is where those imports actually
resolve, honestly: `task_scheduler`, `event_bus`, `diagnostics`, and
`tutorial_manager` here are real, directly-importable singletons a plugin's
own code imports by their true location — not `sys.modules` injected under
the Hub's namespace to make an old import statement keep working unchanged.

`tutorial_manager` here is a real `AcademyManager` (see `academy.py`), wired
to this process's own local `CentralEventBus` and its own per-plugin
persistence directory. It runs every course a plugin registers that only
touches the plugin's own live UI — `InteractionStep`/`VerificationStep`/
`ActionStep`, which is everything every course shipped in this codebase
uses today. The one thing it genuinely can't do is advance a
`WaitForEventStep` gated on an event only the Hub can see (there is no
Hub->plugin event push channel yet); no plugin course uses that step type,
so this is a real, complete engine for every course that exists.
